# Identity & Access Management Labs ðŸš€

This repository showcases practical IAM labs I'm working through as I transition deeper into the Identity space. Focus areas include:

- Active Directory (on-prem & cloud)
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- SSO/Federation (SAML, OIDC)
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Conditional Access, MFA
- JML automation via PowerShell

Each folder contains a hands-on walkthrough, scripts, or diagrams to demonstrate the concepts.

Stay tuned and feel free to follow my journey here.
